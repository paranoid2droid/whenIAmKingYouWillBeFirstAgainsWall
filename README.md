(for which I call it a "Chulbum")

## Insights

This is an open-source album based on ChucK.
It is totally code-generated and you can run the code on your own with the environment required.
You will find that every time you "run" a song by the source code, it would be different.
Although my Chulbum is just less than 15 minutes, you can make your own a thousand years long.

## Listen

Listen the chulbum on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/paranoid2droid/sets/wheniamkingyouwillbefirstagain

Or on Bandcamp: https://theartifactsofripples.bandcamp.com/album/wheniamkingyouwillbefirstagainstwall

(you can actually go to listen it because it is just 13'54'' long hahaha)

## Instruction

1. Install Chuck and MiniAudicle: https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/
2. Clone the codes.
3. Run the ".ck" file with the same name as the track and you will hear the corresponding song in album!
4. Mess up the codes as you like!
