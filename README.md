An Open-source Music Album Based on ChucK

(for which I call it a "Chulbum")

## Insights

This is an open-source album based on ChucK.
It is totally code-generated and you can run the code on your own with the environment required.
You will find that every time you "run" a song by the source code, it would be different.
Although my Chulbum is just less than 15 minutes, you can make your own a thousand years long.
